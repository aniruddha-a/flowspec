TBD
---------------------
- Handle the 'm' bit in the bitwise op
  The bitwise operator has 'not' bit and 'match' bit; I have not considered
  the 'match' bit for the sake of simplicity, also it makes sense only when
  actually matching a value against a packet/field. In the encode, match bit
  is always set by the encoder.
- Better tokenising of & and | in the component data parsing
- remove all static allocations
- store all the protocol name strings like 'tcp', 'udp' etc 
  in a trie like DS for faster association with value
  and the same DS can be used for the flow spec tokens as well
  (ip.proto, port.src ...)
